Instructions
============

1. Running the testsuite

# get input and boundary data for testsuite simulations
./data/get_data.sh

# link (or copy) to the executable you want to test
ln -s ../../fv3.exe .

# run the testsuite
sbatch submit.slurm

2. Generating new references

Note that references should be generated using a double precision executable in the
GNU docker image, since otherwise the double precision test will fail.

In order to generate new references run all test with the executable that you would
like to use to generate new references. Some tests may FAIL but none of the tests
should CRASH. Once all tests have run, you can rerun the full testsuite but add
the --update-yufiles option to the testsuite.py command. This will copy the reference
files from the work/ directory to the data/ directory. Once the new references are
in place, you should commit them to the repository at the same time as your code
modifications which are the cause for having to generate new references.
